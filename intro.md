Introduction to Data Engineering
Welcome to the Data Engineering & Analytics Guide, a comprehensive resource for understanding the foundations of data engineering and analytics. This book covers key concepts, tools, and techniques used in modern data pipelines, warehousing, analysis, and visualization.
What is Data Engineering?
Data engineering involves designing, building, and maintaining systems that collect, store, and process data at scale. It enables organizations to transform raw data into actionable insights.

Key Responsibilities:
Building scalable ETL/ELT pipelines
Managing data warehouses and lakes
Ensuring data quality and reliability
Optimizing data storage and retrieval



Why Data Analytics?
Data analytics focuses on extracting insights from data using statistical methods, SQL, and visualization tools. It complements data engineering by turning processed data into business value.
