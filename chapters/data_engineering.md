Introduction to Data Engineering
Data engineering is the backbone of any data-driven organization. It involves creating robust systems to handle data ingestion, transformation, and storage.
Core Concepts

Data Sources: Structured (databases), semi-structured (JSON, CSV), unstructured (text, images).
Pipelines: Automated workflows for moving and transforming data.
Scalability: Handling increasing data volumes efficiently.
Data Quality: Ensuring accuracy, completeness, and consistency.

Example: Data Pipeline Architecture

    B -->|Transform| C[Data Warehouse]
    C -->|Query| D[Analytics]
    D -->|Visualize| E[Dashboards]

Sample Python Code for Data Ingestion
Below is a simple Python script using pandas to ingest a CSV file and perform basic cleaning.
import pandas as pd

# Load CSV data
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Basic cleaning
df = df.dropna()  # Remove missing values
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])  # Convert to datetime

# Save to parquet for efficient storage
df.to_parquet('cleaned_data.parquet')

This script demonstrates reading data, cleaning it, and storing it in a modern format like Parquet.
